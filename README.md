# QRReaderDemo
Cloned and slightly modified project from Simon Ng's example http://www.appcoda.com/qr-code-reader-swift/.

My goal for this example is to provide a simple, working example in Swift for new developers on the 
iOS platform / AppCode to start coding.

This example could almost certainly be enhanced and extended. Please feel free to clone, improve and issue pull-requests to
me. I'd be delighted and honored!
